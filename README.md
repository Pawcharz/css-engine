# CSS Engine

This repository contains a simple CSS processing engine written in Python. The program is designed to read CSS sections interleaved with command sections from standard input, parse the CSS sections and place them in the appropriate data structures, and parse and execute the command sections, printing any results to standard output.

## Getting Started

To use the CSS engine, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
- `git clone https://github.com/Pawcharz/css-engine.git`

To run the program, navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine and run it with the Visual Studio IDE (Of course, you can manually compile the files)

## Usage

The program will start and wait for input. You can then enter your CSS sections and commands.
